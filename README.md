# 0x11. C - printf
Hello, Welcome to our first team project.
We're going to replicating the printf() fucntion from the C Standard Library.

This Repo has all the code necessary for our project team (Samuel Aberra and Abdulrasheed Aliyu) custom function called _printf().
It is a mini-version of C Language function printf() from stdlib.h and our function _printf() attempts to replicate the exact same process as the C function printf(). 
This project was completed as a part of the curriculum for a software development program on ALX.This Repo has all the code necessary for our (Samuel Aberra and Abdulrasheed Aliyu) custom function called _printf().
